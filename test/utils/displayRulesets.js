/**
 * Logs the current enabled/disabled state of each rule in the Spectral instance's ruleset.
 * This function iterates through all rules in the Spectral ruleset and logs their names along with their enabled/disabled status.
 * It is particularly useful for debugging and testing purposes to ensure that the correct rules are enabled or disabled before running validations.
 *
 * @param {Spectral} spectral - An instance of Spectral, which contains the ruleset whose rules' states are to be displayed.
 * 
 * Example Usage:
 * - Call displayRulesets(spectral) to print the enabled/disabled status of all rules in the given Spectral instance.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - The function does not return any value; its primary purpose is to log information to the console.
 * - It uses ANSI color codes to visually distinguish between enabled (green) and disabled (red) rules.
 * - Ensure that console logging is appropriate for your use case (e.g., debugging) as it may not be suitable in production environments.
 * @returns {void}
